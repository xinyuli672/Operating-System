This 'sanity' directory and its contents were generated because you ran sanitycheck3
The mycode3.c and pa3d.c files in this directory came from your ~/pa3/pa3.tar file
Assuming you did not modify the ~/pa3/pa3.tar file, it corresponds to what was submitted by turninprogram3
You may wish to check that it matches what you intended to submit, i.e., the mycode3.c and pa3d.c files in your pa3 directory
