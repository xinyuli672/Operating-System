This 'sanity' directory and its contents were generated because you ran sanitycheck4
The mycode4.c file in this directory came from your ~/pa4/pa4.tar file
Assuming you did not modify the ~/pa4/pa4.tar file, it corresponds to what was submitted by turninprogram4
You may wish to check that it matches what you intended to submit, i.e., the mycode4.c file in your pa4 directory
